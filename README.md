# Django Trips API

This is a Django REST API for managing and retrieving trips, schedules, bookings, and related travel data.

This service is a core component of the [DestinationPak](https://destinationpak.com) project — a platform designed 
to make exploring and booking adventures across Pakistan easier and more accessible.

## Installation
Simply do:
```bash
pip install django-trips
```

## Usage
Add the app into your installed apps in your project's settings file. 
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_trips',
]
```
## Migrate
```
python manage.py migrate 
```
Add the following to your root `urls.py` or to your desired file location.   
```
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('trips/', include('django_trips.urls')),
]
```
This mounts the whole app under your own chosen namespace (`trips/` above - replace with
whatever prefix you like) with the lib's own `v1/` version underneath it, e.g.
`trips/v1/trips/`, `trips/v1/schema/redoc/`. The app versions itself independently of
your project's own API version, so bumping *your* API to `v2` doesn't imply anything
changed in this lib, and vice versa.

If you'd rather skip the lib's own version segment and wire the endpoints directly into
your own scheme, include `django_trips.api.urls` instead:
```
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('trips/', include(('django_trips.api.urls', 'trips-api'), namespace='trips-api')),
]
```

`Trip.get_absolute_url()` and `TripListSerializer`/`TripDetailSerializer`'s `trip_url`
field both need to resolve `trip-detail`'s URL. The serializers do this off the current
request's own resolved namespace, so they work regardless of where you've mounted these
views. `get_absolute_url()` has no request to read that from (e.g. Django admin's "View
on site" calls it bare), so it defaults to the `trips-api` namespace shown above; if you
mount these views under a different namespace instead - e.g. re-exposing them under your
own project's URL scheme rather than including this app's urls.py directly - set
`DJANGO_TRIPS_URL_NAMESPACE` in your settings to match.

## Pricing model

Price lives in two places, and they compose rather than compete:

- **`TripPackage.base_price` / `base_child_price`** — the source-of-truth adult/child
  price for a pricing tier (Standard/Budget/Premium/...). This is an absolute,
  date-independent menu price, set once per tier rather than on every schedule.
- **`TripSchedule.additional_price` / `additional_child_price`** — a flat *surcharge*
  for one specific bookable departure date (e.g. weekend/holiday/peak pricing), added
  on top of whichever package the traveler is booking against. 0 for a regular date.

The final payable price for a package + (optional) schedule + (optional) pickup
location is always resolved via `get_effective_price()`
(`django_trips/services.py`), never by reading `TripPackage`'s fields directly:

```python
from django_trips.services import get_effective_price

get_effective_price(package, schedule=schedule, pickup=pickup)
# {"price": package.base_price + schedule.additional_price + pickup.additional_price,
#  "child_price": package.base_child_price + schedule.additional_child_price + pickup.additional_price}
```

Every `Trip` is guaranteed to always have exactly one **"Standard"** package,
auto-created by a `post_save` signal the moment the trip is saved
(`django_trips/signals.py`) at `base_price=0`/`base_child_price=0` until an admin
sets a real price. Booking a trip that offers no extra tiers still resolves to a
real package under the hood — **no manual package-creation step is required for a
simple, single-price trip.**

### Worked example — a plain 2-night domestic trip, no tiers, no date surcharge

Say a 2-night trip to Hunza has its Standard package priced at `base_price=15000`,
`base_child_price=8000`, with no extra tiers beyond the automatic Standard one,
and no schedule surcharge:

```python
trip = Trip.objects.create(name="2 Nights in Hunza", ...)   # Standard package auto-created here

standard_package = trip.packages.get(name=PackageTier.STANDARD)
standard_package.base_price = 15000
standard_package.base_child_price = 8000
standard_package.save()

schedule = TripSchedule.objects.create(trip=trip, ...)   # additional_price=0 by default

get_effective_price(standard_package, schedule=schedule)
# {"price": 15000, "child_price": 8000}
```

A booking for 2 adults and 1 child on this schedule (via
`POST /trips/<trip_id>/bookings/create/`, omitting `package` so it defaults to
Standard) stores `total_price = 15000 * 2 + 8000 * 1 = 38000` — no package tier
had to be created or selected for this to work correctly.

## Generate random trips.
Before you generate random scripts, make sure you have the required settings available in your project. If you want to use the default settings set `USE_DEFAULT_TRIPS=True`. 
The script depends upon these variables, if you don't want to use the default settings set the 
following settings. 
1. `TRIP_DESTINATIONS`
2. `TRIP_DEPARTURE_LOCATION`
3. `TRIP_LOCATIONS = TRIP_DEPARTURE_LOCATION + TRIP_DESTINATIONS`
4. `TRIP_LOCATIONS_BY_REGION` (optional) - maps each location name above to its
   PROVINCE-level parent, e.g. `{"Gilgit-Baltistan": ("Hunza", "Skardu")}`, so
   `Location.region` resolves instead of staying `None`.
5. `TRIP_HOSTS`
6. `TRIP_FACILITIES`
7. `TRIP_CATEGORIES`
8. `TRIP_GEARS`

```
python manage.py generate_trips --batch_size=100
``` 
Change the `batch_size` variable to create as much of trips you want.

### Filtering & ordering

`GET /trips/` supports the following query parameters (see `TripFilter` in `api/filters.py`):

| Param                          | Description                                                    |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`                          | Case-insensitive partial match on trip name                     |
| `destination`                    | Comma-separated destination slugs, e.g. `?destination=hunza,skardu` |
| `category`                       | Comma-separated category slugs, e.g. `?category=hiking,camping` |
| `duration_from` / `duration_to`  | Trip duration in days (inclusive)                                |
| `price_from` / `price_to`        | Only matches trips with a single published schedule in this price range |
| `date_from` / `date_to`          | Only matches trips with a single published schedule in this date range (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `ordering`                       | One of `name`, `duration`, `price`; prefix with `-` for descending, e.g. `?ordering=-price` |

`GET /trips/upcoming/` supports its own equivalent set of filters (`name`, `price_from`/`price_to`,
`date_from`/`date_to`, `destination`, `duration_from`/`duration_to`) plus
`?ordering=` on `trip__name`, `price`, `start_date`, or `trip__duration`.

## Develop Django Trips
Kick the docker build using the following command. 
```
make build
``` 
This task may take few minutes. 

 
Once the build has been completed, spin up the docker and migrate the database. 
```bash
> make dev.up
> make shell 
> make update_db
```
Create a superuser with username `admin`.

``` bash
> make shell
> python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Create batch of trips. Run the following command inside docker shell.
```bash
> python manage.py  generate_trips --batch_size=100
OR
> make random_trips
```

## Test
Run tests using the following command.
```
make test
```
## Docker Commands

| Action                            | Command        |
